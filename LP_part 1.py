""" descriptive model of the telephone production problem is as follows:

Decision variables:
Number of desk phones produced (DeskProduction)
Number of cellular phones produced (CellProduction)
Objective: Maximize profit
Constraints:
The DeskProduction should be greater than or equal to 100.
The CellProduction should be greater than or equal to 100.
The assembly time for DeskProduction plus the assembly time for CellProduction should not exceed 400 hours.
The painting time for DeskProduction plus the painting time for CellProduction should not exceed 490 hours.
Assembly time for desk production is 0.2 and for cell production it is 0.4
painting time for desk production is 0.5 and for cell it is 0.4
